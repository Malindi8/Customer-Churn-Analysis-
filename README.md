# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Problem Statement

Customer churn—the process of customers discontinuing their relationship with a company—can severely impact revenue and growth. Understanding why customers leave and predicting potential churners is crucial for implementing effective retention strategies.

This project aims to address the following key questions:
- **Who are the customers most likely to churn?**
- **What are the key factors influencing customer churn?**
- **How can we leverage machine learning to predict customer churn?**
- **How can we visualize churn predictions and customer profiles to provide actionable insights?**

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **SQL Server**
- **Power BI**
- **Python**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
  
## Project Steps:
1. **Data Preparation in SQL Server**
   - Setting up SQL Server database.
   - Writing SQL queries to clean and prepare the dataset.

2. **Power BI Transformation**
   - Importing the cleaned data into Power BI.
   - Creating calculated fields and optimizing data for reporting.

3. **Power BI Visualization & Enhancing Visuals**   

    - Creating intuitive and informative visualizations to represent customer churn patterns. 
    - Use of advanced features like slicers, drill-through, and conditional formatting to enhance the dashboard.

3. **Building Machine Learning Model in Python**
   - Preprocessing data for the model.
   - Training and evaluating a Random Forest model to predict churn.
   - Exporting the results for visualization.

4. **Power BI Visualization**
   - Importing model results into Power BI.
   - Creating visualizations to show churn predictions and customer profiles.
